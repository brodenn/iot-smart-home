[ðŸ“„ Full Report: Smart Home System.pdf](Smart%20Home%20System.pdf)

A smart home IoT project that integrates various devices for automation, monitoring, and remote control.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **ESP32 Smart Home Main Controller**: Manages the central control of the smart home system, including Wi-Fi connectivity, HTTP server, and TCP server for communication with other devices.
2. **TempHumLightStation**: A peripheral device that monitors temperature, humidity, and light levels, and communicates with the main controller.

## Hardware and Features

This project integrates various hardware components and features to create a smart home system for automation, monitoring, and remote control. The system consists of two main components:

### ESP32 Smart Home Main Controller
- **Hardware**:
  - **ESP32 Development Board**: Acts as the central controller for the smart home system.
  - **Shelly Smart Plug S**: Used to control appliances such as heaters and dehumidifiers via HTTP commands.
- **Features**:
  - Wi-Fi initialization and event handling.
  - HTTP server for user interaction and setpoint updates.
  - TCP server for communication with peripheral devices.
  - Logging and debugging support using ESP32's logging library.
  - Sends HTTP commands to control appliances via Shelly Smart Plug S.

### TempHumLightStation
- **Hardware**:
  - **Arduino Uno**: Serves as the microcontroller for the peripheral station.
  - **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module**: Provides Wi-Fi connectivity for communication with the ESP32.
  - **SparkFun Weather Shield**: Includes sensors for temperature, humidity, and light intensity.
    - **Si7021 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
    - **Light Sensor**: Measures ambient light intensity.
- **Features**:
  - Reads temperature, humidity, and light sensor data using the SparkFun Weather Shield.
  - Stores and retrieves configuration settings from EEPROM.
  - Handles TCP communication with the main controller.
  - Automates actions based on sensor data and setpoints.

## Communication

The system uses multiple communication protocols:
- **Arduino â†” ESP8266 (UART)**: Sends AT commands for Wi-Fi connectivity and communicates with the ESP32 over TCP.
- **Arduino â†” ESP32 (TCP WiFi)**: Sends sensor data and receives setpoint updates.
- **ESP32 â†” Shelly Plug S (HTTP)**: Sends commands to control the heater and humidifier.
- **ESP32 â†” Web Dashboard (HTTP Server)**: Displays real-time sensor values and allows remote setpoint updates.
